              Hi, I’m Xiuxiu. I’m a first-generation college student and started my career as a research assistant at a small market research agency, where I worked across various industries and geographies. It was fast-paced and intellectually demanding, and it taught me how to learn quickly and adapt to new challenges.

              <br />
              <br />Over time, I realized I wanted to do more than advocate for users—I wanted to build the solutions myself. That’s what sparked my transition into tech. I’m now pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Northeastern University. Over the past two years, I’ve completed internships and built several personal projects, gaining hands-on experience in full-stack development and cloud computing.

              <br />
              <br />
              Moving forward, I hope to contribute as a software engineer to projects that combine user-centered design with scalable backend systems and cloud infrastructure. Ultimately, I want to build technology that genuinely improves people’s lives.
              <br />
              <br />
              Whenever possible, I also apply my passion for developing products
