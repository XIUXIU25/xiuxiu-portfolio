              Hi, I’m Xiuxiu. I’m a first-generation college student and began my career as a UX researcher and market research assistant, working across industries and geographies. The work was fast-paced and intellectually demanding—it sharpened my ability to uncover user needs, synthesize insights, and adapt quickly to new challenges.

              <br />
              <br />Over time, I realized I wanted to do more than study user behavior and advocate for users—I wanted to design and build the solutions myself. That realization sparked my transition into tech. I’m now pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Northeastern University. Over the past two years, I’ve completed internships and built several personal projects, gaining hands-on experience in full-stack development and cloud computing.

              <br />
              <br />
             Looking ahead, I hope to contribute as a software engineer to projects that combine user-centered design principles with scalable backend systems and cloud infrastructure. Ultimately, I want to build technology that genuinely improves people’s lives.
